## I'll be analyzing the Wage dataset and I'll creating a linear model that predicted the wage of a worker based only on the workerâ€™s age. 
```{r}
## Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)


## Loading the data
data(Wage)

## Statistical summary on the Wage dataset
summary(Wage)

## Building training and testing sets
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=Wage$wage, p=.7, list=FALSE)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]
testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]

## Taking a look at the rows of each training and testing sets
nrow(training)
nrow(testing)

#### Developing a linear model that predicts the average wage based on are and education ####

## Building a linear model that predicts the wage of a worker based only on the worker's age
lm_wage <- lm(wage ~ age, data = Wage)

## Building a linear model that predicts the wage of a worker based on the worker's age and education

lm_wage_education <- lm(wage ~ age + education, data = Wage)

## Plotting a scatter plot matrix on the training dataset to see if there's a correlation between wage on age or education. The result shows a correlation between wage and education level.
pairs(training$wage)
featurePlot(x=training[,c("age", "education")],
            y=training$wage,
            plot="pairs")

## Plot the training dataset using a qplot color coded by education

wage_correlation <- qplot(age, wage, color=education, data=training)
wage_correlation +  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ x)

## In conclusion, we can see that individuals with higher degree makes more money than those people with a lower degree
